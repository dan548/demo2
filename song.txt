[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning, I feel so fucking important
I looked in the mirror, I'm different, I finally made a decision
All the rejected that lost a lack of respect in
Themselves 'cause people get hectic
They hurt you and make you feel helpless
They're not brave like you, they're too scared to do
Anything that's different, anything that's new
I don't need lessons, I do what I want, it's refreshing
As soon as you taste independencе
You start living life in the presеnt


[Chorus]
Hey there, how you been?
I'm the voice in your head and I know you been aching
When you find me, let me in
I got power in my hands and it's yours for the taking
